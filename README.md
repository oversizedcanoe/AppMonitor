# AppMonitor

An android app to monitor usage (screentime) of other apps, built with Ionic using Angular. A work in progress.

Note: in ```package.json```, [app-list-capacitor](https://github.com/oversizedcanoe/app-list-capacitor) is referenced as a local folder. This is another repo of mine, which is also a work in progress.
