  Welcome to App Monitor. This app allows you to track app usage of specific apps. 
  It also sends push notifications when chosen apps reach certain usage metrics, such as being open for five minutes straight, 
  or thirty total minutes in one day.

  Click next to chose the apps you wish to monitor. By default, you'll be notified after using them for five consecutive minutes,
  but you can customize specifics of everything later.
